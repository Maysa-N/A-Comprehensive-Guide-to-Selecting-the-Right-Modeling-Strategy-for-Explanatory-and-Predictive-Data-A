#This study provides a comprehensive guide for navigating the complex model selection process in biostatistics, breaking it down into five main sections. It highlights critical decision points, trade-offs, and real-world considerations to support transparent, reproducible, and rigorous research. To demonstrate the frameworkâ€™s utility, we applied it to a real-world dataset of COVID-19 patients (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TAS2PH), comparing the performance of three candidate models: regularized logistic regression, random forest (RF), and GLMMLasso.
